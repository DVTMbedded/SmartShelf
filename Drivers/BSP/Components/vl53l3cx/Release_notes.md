# Purpose

The driver is an implementation of a set of functions required to use the VL53L3CX
Time of Flight sensor. It makes minimal assumptions on the OS integration and services. As such,
sequencing of actions, execution/threading model, platform adaptation, and device
structures allocation are not part of the bare driver implementation but left open to the
integrator.
